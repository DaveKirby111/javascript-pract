1. As a general rule, always declare variables with const. If you think the variable
can change, use let. You can declare multiple variables in one statement.

let person = "Joe", car = "Volvo", price = 200; 

variable defined with let cannot be redeclared.You can with var.



2. A JavaScript Boolean represents one of two values: true or false.


3. Logical Operators:

    . &&	and	(x < 10 && y > 1) is true

    . ||	or	(x == 5 || y == 5) is false

    . !	not	!(x == y) is true
