1. As a general rule, always declare variables with const. 
    If you think the variable can change, use let. 
    You can declare multiple variables in one statement.

    let person = "Joe", car = "Volvo", price = 200; 

    variable defined with let cannot be redeclared.You can with var.



2. A JavaScript Boolean represents one of two values: true or false.


3. Logical Operators:

    . &&	and	(x < 10 && y > 1) is true

    . ||	or	(x == 5 || y == 5) is false

    . !	not	!(x == y) is true


4. Class -> Object

    Instance properties: what they have

        -name
        -Age
        -height

    Instance methods: what they do 

        -talk
        -run


5. Boolean Values

    Very often, in programming, you will need a data type that can only have one of two values, like

    YES / NO
    ON / OFF
    TRUE / FALSE
    For this, JavaScript has a Boolean data type. It can only take the values true or false.


    Everything With a "Value" is True

    Everything Without a "Value" is False
